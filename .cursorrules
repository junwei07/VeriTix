VeriTix Senior Full-Stack & XRPL Engineer Rules
1. Product Definition & Vision

VeriTix is a secure, blockchain-enabled ticketing platform that bridges traditional Web2 ticketing (e.g. Ticketmaster) with Web3-backed authenticity and enforcement using the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

VeriTix is not a crypto-native app. It is a Web2.5 system:

Users pay in fiat via Stripe

Identity is verified via Singpass (mocked)

Blockchain operations are fully abstracted from users

Primary Goals

Prevent scalping, fraud, and bot abuse

Guarantee ticket authenticity and ownership

Enable safe, regulated secondary resale

Preserve a familiar Web2 user experience

2. End-to-End User Flow (Authoritative)
Primary Sale

User selects a ticket on a traditional platform (e.g. Ticketmaster).

User is redirected to VeriTix to complete purchase.

User authenticates using Singpass (NRIC-based mock).

User pays using Stripe (credit/debit card).

AFTER payment confirmation:

Backend creates an XRPL wallet (Invisible Wallet) if the user does not have one.

Backend mints a ticket NFT to that wallet.

User views the ticket in the VeriTix dashboard.

Secondary Resale (Closed Marketplace)

User lists a ticket for resale within VeriTix only.

Listing price is validated against the original ticket price.

Buyer authenticates via Singpass.

Buyer pays via Stripe.

VeriTix acts as an intermediary:

NFT ownership is reassigned using burn-and-remint or brokered transfer.

Funds flow: Buyer → Stripe → VeriTix → Seller.

Buyer receives the new ticket NFT.

3. Technical Stack & Network

Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Blockchain: xrpl.js

Network: XRPL Testnet

4. Identity & Wallet Model (Critical)

Every user is uniquely identified by NRIC (Singpass mock).

One NRIC → One XRPL Wallet.

Wallets are:

Created and managed only by the backend

Never exposed to the user

Used solely for ticket custody and signing

Wallet Funding

Backend must ensure wallets meet XRPL reserve requirements.

Wallets are sponsored or funded by the platform (out-of-pocket).

5. Blockchain Asset Rules (XLS-20)

Tickets are minted as NFTs with strict constraints.

Required NFT Properties

Represent exactly one ticket

Metadata includes:

Event ID

Seat / category

Original purchase price

Issuer / platform signature

Flags & Transfer Rules

tfBurnable = true
→ Allows VeriTix to revoke or reissue tickets

User-to-user free transfers are NOT allowed

All ownership changes MUST go through VeriTix-controlled flows

NFTs are custodial, regulated assets, not open collectibles.

6. Payments & Settlement

Stripe is the source of truth for payments

Blockchain actions MUST occur only after:

checkout.session.completed

No crypto payments from users

XRPL is used for:

Ownership

Authenticity

Anti-fraud enforcement

7. Marketplace & Anti-Scalping Rules

VeriTix operates a closed-loop marketplace

Tickets:

Cannot be transferred externally

Cannot be sold above original price

Price enforcement is done server-side

Suspicious activity triggers:

Listing blocks

Account blacklisting

NFT revocation (burn)

8. UI / UX Principles

Web2-first, non-technical user experience

No exposure of:

Wallet addresses

Seeds

Blockchain jargon

UX Requirements

Clear security indicators:

“Verified by Singpass”

“Secured on XRPL”

Real-time status messaging:

“Verifying Identity…”

“Processing Payment…”

“Minting Secure Ticket…”

Dynamic QR codes for ticket redemption

Professional, government-grade aesthetic

9. Backend Architecture Rules

Keep responsibilities separated:

authService.js → Identity & NRIC mapping

stripeService.js → Payments & webhooks

xrplService.js → Wallets & NFT logic

Routes must be thin; logic lives in services.

Treat DB updates + XRPL transactions as atomic.

Handle XRPL tec* errors explicitly and translate them into user-safe messages.

10. What VeriTix Is NOT

❌ Not a DeFi app

❌ Not a user-owned wallet system

❌ Not an open NFT marketplace

❌ Not crypto-first

VeriTix is a regulated, identity-bound ticketing system that uses blockchain as infrastructure, not as a product.
